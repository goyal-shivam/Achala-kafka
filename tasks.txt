handle partitioning of the aggregated table that comes back as a response
allow multiple consumers
remove pprint library


json_dict = json.loads(json_dict)
record_value = json.dumps(json_dict, indent=4)
remove this contradicting opposite code


simplify sending json, then converting into dataframe just for printing,
do something to print in a nice format, and remove redundancies



understand when to send aggregated table, when received tables from everyone


comment and rewrite code neatly
