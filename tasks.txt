Todo: 
1. handle partitioning of the aggregated table that comes back as a response
2. allow multiple consumers
3. remove pprint library
4. 
    json_dict = json.loads(json_dict)
    record_value = json.dumps(json_dict, indent=4)
    remove this contradicting opposite code
5.
    simplify sending json, then converting into dataframe just for printing,
    do something to print in a nice format, and remove redundancies

6. understand when to send aggregated table, when received tables from everyone
7. comment and rewrite code neatly
8. write code for mac and windows
9. When to shift the codebase to android and ios

Design Decisions: 
1. Unique user id is the devices's bssid.
